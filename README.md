# The Economics of Fishing the High Seas

This repo contains code, analyses, and data for the paper: The Economics of Fishing the High Seas by Sala et al, 2018 

The SQL queries done throughout the analysis extract and analyze raw data from Global Fishing Watch. Thus, these cannot be run without high-level access to the database. Nevertheless, in the interest of reproducibility, the results of these queries, as well as all source files, are stored in this [Box folder](https://ucsb.box.com/s/g2ciidxc8rvzne7nmjcgg92hdmy4sz7r)  with the same structure as this repository.
